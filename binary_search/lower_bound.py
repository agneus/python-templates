# search for first index satisfying condition (a[i] >= target)
# if condition is true, save answer and move left
# if condition is false, move right
# returns index of first valid element or -1 if not found

# Setup example
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

# ðŸ§  Mental Intuition:
# Imagine your array as a sequence of booleans:
#   false false false true true true
# You want the index of the first true.
# In this case, the "condition" is a[i] >= target.
# This pattern is called "binary search on condition".
# Works as long as condition becomes true and stays true.
